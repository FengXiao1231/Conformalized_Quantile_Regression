# Conformalized Quantile Regression for Adaptive Prediction Intervals

Welcome to the repository for **Conformalized Quantile Regression (CQR) for Adaptive Prediction Intervals**. This project investigates the application of CQR to construct adaptive prediction intervals with valid coverage guarantees, particularly in heteroscedastic data scenarios in high-risk domains like finance and real estate. The analysis leverages datasets such as the UCI Real Estate Valuation Dataset and the Lending Club Loan Dataset.

## Getting Started

### Final Code
The final implementation of the CQR methodology, along with the scripts for reproducing the analysis, is available in the **`FinalCode/`** directory.

### Dataset
To comply with repository storage limitations, the datasets used in this project are not included. However, you can download them from the following sources:
- **[UCI Real Estate Valuation Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Real+estate+valuation+data+set)**
- **Lending Club Loan Dataset** (available on platform Kaggle)

Place the downloaded datasets in the directories specified in the code.

## Repository Structure
- **`FinalCode/`**: Contains the finalized Python scripts for CQR implementation and analysis.
- **`README.md`**: Project overview and setup instructions.

## Instructions
1. Download the datasets from the sources listed above.
2. Preprocess the datasets as specified in the **Methodology** section of the documentation.
3. Run the scripts in the **`FinalCode/`** directory to perform the analysis and generate prediction intervals.
