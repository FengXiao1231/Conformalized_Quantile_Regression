# UCI and Lending Club Loan Dataset Analysis

Welcome to the repository for the UCI and Lending Club Loan Dataset analysis. This project involves analyzing loan data to uncover patterns and build predictive models. The final code for this analysis is available in this repository.

## Getting Started

### Final Code
You can directly view and run the final code by accessing the [Final Code](./Final%20Code.ipynb) directory in this repository. This directory contains all the necessary scripts and files to reproduce the analysis results.

### Dataset
Due to GitHub's file size limitations, the Lending Club Loan Dataset is not included in this repository. However, you can easily obtain the dataset by searching for **"Lending Club Loan Dataset"** on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). Once downloaded, place the dataset in the appropriate directory specified in the code.

## Repository Structure
- **FinalCode/**: Contains the final version of the code for analysis.
- **README.md**: This file.

## Instructions
1. Download the dataset from Kaggle.
2. Place the dataset in the specified directory in the project.
3. Run the scripts in the `FinalCode` directory to perform the analysis.

## Acknowledgments
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Lending Club and made available on Kaggle.
